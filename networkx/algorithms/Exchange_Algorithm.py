This is an implementation for two different algorithms described on "MAXIMUM WEIGHT CYCLE PACKING IN DIRECTED GRAPHS,
WITH APPLICATION TO KIDNEY EXCHANGE PROGRAMS" article.
The article points on two algorithms that solves kidney exchange problems, which can be modelled as cycle packing
problems in a directed graph, involving cycles of length 2, 3, or even longer.
In the article we focus on the maximal exchange of circles of size 2 and 3 vertices, we demonstrate an approximation
algorithm and an exact algorithm for this problem.

    Algorithm - the algorithm finds the exact maximum weight k-way exchanges using reduction from directed graph to non directed
    graph
    "Algorithm 2 - Exact algorithm for kidney exchange programs" by Biro, P. and Manlove, D.F. and Rizzi, R.
    Returns the list of max weighted exchanges of directed weighted graph 'G'

    A directed weighted graph is a graph in which every edge is one sided and weighted
    for example an edge from node 1->2 with a weight of 5,an k-way exchange
    is a circle within a graph containing at most k nodes.
    max weighted exchange is a circle with the most weighted edges from every node in the circle

    Parameters
    -----------
    G : NetworkX DiGraph
        Directed graph with weights

    Returns
    -----------
    Lst: list of lists
        Each list in lst contaning the nodes which make up the circle with the highest weights sum
    Examples
    -----------


    >>> Digraph=nx.DiGraph()
    >>> Digraph.add_nodes_from([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8])
