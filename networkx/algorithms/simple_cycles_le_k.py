    """
    Find simple cycles (elementary circuits) of a directed graph.
    A simple cycle, or elementary circuit, is a closed path where no node appears twice.
    Two elementary circuits are distinct if they are not cyclic permutations of each other.
    This is a nonrecursive, iterator/generator modified version of Johnsonâ€™s algorithm
    for finding all elementary cycles in a graph so that is does not search for cycles larger than some maximum length.
